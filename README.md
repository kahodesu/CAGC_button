CAGC_button
===========
This is code that I use in my class Costumes as Game Controllers to teach building switches using Adafruit's FLORA. 
It's a mash up of the following examples:

1. DigitalInputPull example on the Arduino IDE. 
2. Arduino Debounce Tutorial http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce
3. Arduino Mouse Keyboard http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/MouseKeyboard

The Debounce and Keyboard stuff are commented out so that the student can learn the basic pull up switch concept
with a basic tactile push button, then move on to other experimental interfaces such as gloves with conductive
pads. Debounce comes in handy when using conductive fabrics and other materials that may not be so stable. Keyboard 
capabilities come in handy to connect to software, whatever the student decides to make it in.
